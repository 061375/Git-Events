# Git-Events
A simple Drupal 8 module to gather and display GIT commits and issues

## About

This is my first "practical" Drupal 8 module. So, at least at the time of the writing of the readme file there are some legacy files and code from the module tutorials.

99% of the magic is located in src/Plugin/Block/GitEventsBlock.php
